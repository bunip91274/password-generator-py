## Description

This is a Python-based password generator that creates **random, secure** passwords. Users can choose between:

- **Strong passwords**: randomized combinations of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols — with user-defined length.
- **Weak passwords**: generated by randomly combining two simple words.

The script ensures strong password randomness by mixing characters from all pools and handling uneven lengths.



## How It Works

- When run, the program asks whether you want a **strong (s)** or **weak (w)** password.
- If strong, it prompts for desired length (e.g., 12 or 16).
- If weak, it combines two random words from a pre-defined list.
- The final password is printed to the screen.
